# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Lawyer_Agentic project.

## Project Overview

**Lawyer_Agentic** is an AI-powered workflow orchestration system designed specifically for legal professionals. This project aims to create "magic button" workflows that replace hours of paralegal work with 30-second AI-powered processes. It's part of the larger Serup.ai ecosystem and integrates with the LexWeave legal platform.

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Initial Setup (Week 1 Implementation)
- ✅ Virtual environment created (Python 3.13.5)
- ⏳ Awaiting implementation of core project structure
- ⏳ Base workflow classes need to be implemented
- ⏳ FastAPI service setup pending
- ⏳ Docker configuration pending

## Development Guidelines

### Project Management and Code Workflow
- Always use GitHub CLI to push to the serup.ai organization
- Commit very frequently during development
- Use semantic versioning (semver) for tags:
  * Bump patch version for bugfixes
  * Bump minor version for new features
- Never use mock integrations - focus on proven, working systems
- Resolve problems directly without creating redundant code or files
- Prioritize robust, direct solutions over workarounds
